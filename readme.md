The objective of this project is to provide a rest service to support the same database
I worked with for my Hospital Database JavaFX application, as well as a provide a few custom defined
endpoints I think would be useful. Currently also for HTTP verbs for manipulating data and searching
by first name and last via their respective endpoints.

Example first name search
/patients/searchFName?q=name 

Example last name seach
/patients/searchLName?q=name
